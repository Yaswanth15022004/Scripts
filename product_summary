1. We create a progress bar with 8 tasks.{Load CSVs,Pivot EAV,Merge,Fix brand,Add status,Build categories,Add season,Export file}
2. Workflow 1 → LOAD FULL DATAFRAME -->(read → store → concat → merge → filter
Workflow 2 → PROCESS CHUNK BY CHUNK-->(read → process → write out → delete chunk)

Step 1 — Process varchar chunks → make full_varchar parquet

→ merge to base
→ delete all varchar temp files

Step 2 — Process int chunks

→ merge
→ delete int temp files

And so on.
